    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git reset --soft HEAD~3\n",

    "     This moves the branch pointer back three commits but retains the changes in the staging area for further editing or recommitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How would you contribute to an open-source project using GitHub?**  \n",
    "   - **Steps**:  \n",
    "     1. Fork the repository to your account.  \n",
    "     2. Clone the forked repository locally:  \n",

    "        git push origin feature-branch\n",
    "        ```  \n",
    "     6. Create a pull request from the forked repository to the original repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You accidentally committed sensitive information. How would you remove it from the repository history?**  \n",

    "   - Example with `git filter-repo` (modern replacement for `git filter-branch`):  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git filter-repo --path <file> --invert-paths\n",
    "     ```  \n",

    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git push origin --force\n",
    "     ```  \n",
    "   - Inform collaborators to clone or reset their repositories to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Your team wants to clean up the commit history before merging a feature branch. How would you proceed?**  \n",

    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git rebase -i main\n",
    "     ```  \n",
    "     - Squash or reword commits during the rebase.  \n",
    "     - Push changes with force:  \n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       git push origin feature-branch --force\n",
    "       ```  \n",
    "     - Ensure no one else is working on the same branch to avoid conflicts.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explain how you would set up continuous integration (CI) for a project hosted on GitHub.**  \n",
    "   - Use **GitHub Actions**:  \n",
    "     1. Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file in your repository.  \n",

    "6. **How do you manage multiple collaborators working on the same file to avoid conflicts?**  \n",
    "   - **Strategies**:  \n",
    "     1. Use feature branches for each collaborator.  \n",
    "     2. Regularly pull changes from the main branch:  \n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        git pull origin main\n",
    "        ```  \n",

    "### **GitHub-Specific Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a fork in GitHub? How is it different from a clone?**  \n",
    "   - **Fork**: A copy of a repository in your GitHub account for independent work.  \n",
    "   - **Clone**: A local copy of a repository on your system.  \n",
    "   - Forking allows collaboration with the original repository via pull requests, while cloning doesn’t inherently support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is a pull request? How do you review and merge it?**  \n",
    "   - A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch (or fork) into another.  \n",
    "   - **Steps to review and merge**:  \n",
    "     1. Navigate to the \"Pull Requests\" tab on GitHub.  \n",
    "     2. Review code changes under \"Files Changed.\"  \n",
    "     3. Add comments or suggestions.  \n",
    "     4. Approve and click \"Merge Pull Request.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explain GitHub Actions and how they are used.**  \n",
    "   - GitHub Actions automate workflows (e.g., testing, deployment).  \n",
    "   - Workflows are defined in YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory.  \n",
    "   - Examples:  \n",
    "     - Running tests on pull requests.  \n",
    "     - Deploying applications to a server.\n",

    "4. **What are GitHub Issues, and how are they managed?**  \n",
    "   - GitHub Issues track tasks, enhancements, and bugs.  \n",
    "   - **Management**:  \n",
    "     1. Create issues using templates.  \n",
    "     2. Assign labels and collaborators.  \n",
    "     3. Link issues to pull requests for better traceability.  \n",
    "     4. Close issues once resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How do you protect the main branch on a GitHub repository?**  \n",
    "   - Enable branch protection rules:  \n",
    "     1. Go to the repository’s **Settings > Branches > Add Rule**.  \n",
    "     2. Set rules like requiring pull requests, status checks, or specific reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What are the different types of collaboration tools available on GitHub?**  \n",
    "   - Pull requests and code reviews.  \n",
    "   - GitHub Issues for task tracking.  \n",
    "   - GitHub Projects for Kanban boards.  \n",
    "   - GitHub Discussions for community interaction.\n",

    "7. **How can you automate releases and versioning using GitHub?**  \n",
    "   - Use **GitHub Actions** with release automation tools:  \n",
    "     - Example Action:  \n",
    "       ```yaml\n",
    "       name: Release Automation\n",
